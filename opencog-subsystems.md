## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential Processing
Tasks that require step-by-step reasoning through multiple subsystems

### Pattern 2: Parallel Processing
Tasks that benefit from simultaneous activation of multiple subsystems

### Pattern 3: Hierarchical Processing
Tasks with multiple levels of abstraction requiring hierarchical coordination

### Pattern 4: Iterative Processing
Tasks requiring feedback loops and iterative refinement

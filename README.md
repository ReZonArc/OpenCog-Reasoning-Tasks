Welcome to the **OpenCog-LLM Reasoning Task Collection** repository! This project maps reasoning tasks to OpenCog's cognitive architecture subsystems and provides a framework for integrating OpenCog's AGI capabilities with Large Language Model natural language abilities.

## OpenCog Integration

This repository extends the original LLM reasoning tasks with:
- **OpenCog Subsystem Mappings**: Each task is mapped to relevant OpenCog components (PLN, AtomSpace, Pattern Matcher, etc.)
- **Cognitive Architecture Classifications**: Tasks are categorized by processing type (Symbolic, Sub-symbolic, Hybrid, Meta-cognitive)
- **Integration Framework**: Architecture for combining OpenCog formal reasoning with LLM natural language capabilities

## Introduction

The goal of this repository is to gather a diverse set of reasoning tasks designed to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Contributors are encouraged to submit tasks, provide examples, and optionally include diagrams or workflows to illustrate how the tasks function.

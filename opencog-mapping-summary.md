# OpenCog Reasoning Tasks Mapping Summary

This document provides an overview of how the reasoning tasks in this repository map to OpenCog's cognitive architecture subsystems.

## Mapping Statistics

### Primary Subsystem Usage
Based on the analysis of 88+ reasoning tasks:

**Most Frequently Used Primary Subsystems:**
1. **PLN (Probabilistic Logic Networks)** - 45 tasks
   - Core reasoning engine for logical inference
   - Handles uncertainty and probabilistic reasoning

2. **Pattern Matcher** - 38 tasks  
   - Graph pattern matching and recognition
   - Essential for analogical and structural reasoning

3. **Natural Language Processing (RelEx)** - 22 tasks
   - Language understanding and generation
   - Critical for text-based reasoning tasks

4. **Cognition Engine (OpenPsi)** - 8 tasks
   - Goal-directed behavior and motivation
   - Key for theory of mind and social reasoning

5. **Learning and Memory** - 12 tasks
   - Pattern learning and concept formation
   - Important for inductive reasoning tasks

6. **Perception and Sensory Processing** - 6 tasks
   - Spatial reasoning and sensory integration
   - Essential for spatial and visual reasoning

### Cognitive Architecture Distribution

**Symbolic Processing: 25 tasks (28%)**
- Formal logic and rule-based reasoning
- Truth tables, syllogisms, mathematical proofs

**Hybrid Processing: 35 tasks (40%)**  
- Combined symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches
- Language understanding, analogical reasoning

**Sub-symbolic Processing: 18 tasks (20%)**
- Pattern recognition, spatial reasoning
- Approximate and probabilistic methods

**Meta-cognitive Processing: 10 tasks (12%)**
- Theory of mind, self-reflection
- Higher-order reasoning about reasoning

### Integration Patterns

**Sequential Processing: 42 tasks (48%)**
- Step-by-step reasoning through subsystems
- Most common for logical and analytical tasks

**Hierarchical Processing: 15 tasks (17%)**  
- Multi-level abstraction and coordination
- Complex problem solving and theory of mind

**Parallel Processing: 12 tasks (14%)**
- Simultaneous activation of multiple subsystems  
- Spatial reasoning and pattern recognition

**Iterative Processing: 19 tasks (21%)**
- Feedback loops and refinement
- Learning and approximation tasks

### Complexity Distribution

**Low: 8 tasks (9%)**
- Simple logical operations
- Basic pattern recognition

**Medium: 45 tasks (51%)**
- Standard reasoning tasks
- Moderate complexity inference

**High: 32 tasks (36%)**
- Complex multi-step reasoning
- Advanced analogical and causal reasoning

**Very High: 3 tasks (4%)**
- Higher-order theory of mind
- Meta-cognitive reasoning

## Key Insights

### 1. OpenCog-LLM Synergy Opportunities
- **Language Interface**: LLMs excel at natural language understanding, while OpenCog provides structured reasoning
- **Uncertainty Handling**: PLN can provide formal uncertainty quantification to complement LLM confidence scores  
- **Attention Management**: ECAN can focus processing on relevant information for improved efficiency
- **Transparent Reasoning**: OpenCog can provide explainable reasoning traces that LLMs often lack

### 2. Subsystem Coordination Patterns
- **PLN + Pattern Matcher**: Most common combination for logical reasoning tasks
- **NLP + AtomSpace**: Essential pairing for language-based reasoning
- **Perception + Pattern Matcher**: Key for spatial and visual reasoning tasks
- **OpenPsi + PLN**: Critical for social and theory of mind reasoning

### 3. Integration Architecture Recommendations
1. **Hybrid Sequential-Parallel**: Use sequential processing for logical steps, parallel for pattern recognition
2. **Attention-Guided Processing**: Use ECAN to prioritize relevant subsystems dynamically  
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Implement feedback loops between LLM and OpenCog for complex tasks
4. **Knowledge Synchronization**: Maintain consistency between LLM embeddings and AtomSpace concepts

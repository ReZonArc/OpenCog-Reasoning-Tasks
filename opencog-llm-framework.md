# OpenCog-LLM Integration Framework

## Architecture Overview

This framework defines how to integrate OpenCog's AGI capabilities with Large Language Model natural language abilities to create a hybrid cognitive architecture optimized for reasoning tasks.

## Core Integration Principles

### 1. Complementary Strengths
- **LLM Strengths**: Natural language understanding, contextual reasoning, broad knowledge
- **OpenCog Strengths**: Formal logic, structured knowledge, transparent reasoning, attention management

### 2. Bidirectional Communication
- **LLM → OpenCog**: Natural language queries converted to AtomSpace representations
- **OpenCog → LLM**: Structured knowledge and reasoning results converted to natural language

### 3. Unified Knowledge Representation
- Central AtomSpace as shared knowledge repository
- LLM embeddings mapped to OpenCog concepts
- Truth values and uncertainty propagated between systems

- Temporal/spatial parsing
- Uncertainty quantification

### 2. Atom-to-NL Generator
Translates OpenCog structures back to natural language:
- Graph-to-text generation
- Explanation generation
- Reasoning trace verbalization
- Uncertainty communication

### 3. Hybrid Reasoning Controller
Orchestrates reasoning between LLM and OpenCog:

   - Choose appropriate OpenCog subsystems
   - Configure LLM reasoning strategy
   - Set up coordination protocol

2. **Parallel Processing**
   - OpenCog formal reasoning
   - LLM contextual analysis
   - Cross-validation of results

### Phase 3: Integration and Response
1. **Result Synthesis**
   - Combine formal and intuitive reasoning
   - Resolve conflicts
   - Compute confidence scores

2. **Response Generation**
   - Generate explanation
   - Provide reasoning trace
   - Suggest follow-up questions

## Optimization Strategies
